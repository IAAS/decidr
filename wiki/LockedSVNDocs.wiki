= Purpose of this document =

Since the `svn lock` feature is disabled in google code, we need to maintain a _*Do Not Edit*_ list. This list should detail the file, including the path in the svn repository (e.g. `/trunk/docs/example.doc`) and the person working on the document. This list should be consulted whenever a binary file is edited.


= Locked Files =

|| *_File_* || *_Locked By_* ||
|| /trunk/docs/pm/WS Developement Schedule.doc || RR ||
