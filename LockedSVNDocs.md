# Purpose of this document #

Since the `svn lock` feature is disabled in google code, we need to maintain a _**Do Not Edit**_ list. This list should detail the file, including the path in the svn repository (e.g. `/trunk/docs/example.doc`) and the person working on the document. This list should be consulted whenever a binary file is edited.
