<!-- 
**Goal**
Forward mail and time web services so they are reachable through Synapse.

Using the default configuration you should see the two deployed services here:
http(s)://localhost:8280/soap/

**Assumptions**

- There is an Axis2 server accepting connections on localhost:8080
- Reinhold's mail WS and Daniel's time WS have been deployed on the Axis2 server.
